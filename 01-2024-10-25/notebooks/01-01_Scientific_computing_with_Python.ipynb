    "Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, many researchers are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort. Software is very important to modern scientific research as the daily operation of science revolves around developing new algorithms, managing and analyzing the large amounts of data that are generated in single research projects, combining disparate datasets to assess synthetic problems, and other computational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense software is just another kind of experimental apparatus and should be built, checked, and used as carefully as any physical apparatus. However, while most scientists are careful to validate their laboratory and field equipment, most do not know how reliable their software is. This can lead to serious errors impacting the central conclusions of published research. In addition, because software is often used for more than a single project, and is often reused by other scientists, computing errors can have disproportionate impacts on the scientific process. \n"
