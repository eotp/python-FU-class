    "[__Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language) is a text-based, machine-readable language (_markup language_) for the structuring of web content. These contents include texts, lists, tables, hyperlinks, images, etc. \n",

    "## Basics HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language)  is not a programming language in the strict sense. It is rather a markup language that describes the structure of a web page. The basic building block of HTML is the so-called _element_. It allows content to be structured and provided with attributes.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "An element can contain text, data, images, etc.. Typically an element starts with an opening tag `<...>`, contains attributes, encloses text and ends with a closing tag `</...>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `p` (_paragraph_) element: \n",
    "\n",
    "`<p>class=\"abcd\">Hello world!</p>`, \n",
    "\n",
    "- `<p>` opening _day_,\n",
    "- `class=\"abcd\"` an attribute and its value,\n",
    "- `'Hello world!'` Text and the\n",
    "- `</p>` closing _day_\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also elements that have no content (_empty elements_):\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img src=\"mypath/image.png\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "This element contains an attribute but no closing tag (`</img>`) and no content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "Heading elements make it possible to display individual text passages as headings of different sizes. HTML contains 6 predefined sizes (`<h1>`â€“`<h6>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Heading 1st order\n",
    "## Heading 2nd order\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<h1>Heading 1st order</h1>\n",
    "<h2>Heading 2nd order</h2>\n",
    "<h3>Heading 3rd order</h3>\n",
    "<h4>Heading 4th order</h4>\n",
    "<h5>Heading 5th order</h5>\n",
    "<h6>Heading 6th order</h6>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraphs \n",
    "The `<p>` element identifies a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p>I'm a paragraph</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<img>` element inserts image files into the document. The `src` (_source_) attribute refers to the path to the image file (a local file or a _url_).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `<!DOCTYPE html>` The document type. A historical artifact that corresponded to a (best-practice) standard in the early 90s. \n",
    "* `<html></html>` The `<html>` element. The element includes the entire content (_root element_).\n",
    "* `<head></head>` The `<head>` element. This element corresponds to a container in which everything relevant can be found that is not part of the content displayed on the web page.\n",
    "* `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">` The element describes the character encoding used.\n",
    "* `<title></title>`  The `<title>` element. It describes the title of the web page that is displayed by the browser in the tab and is also used as the name of the page when it bookmarked.\n",
    "* `<body></body>` The `<body>` element. This element contains all the contents of the website that are displayed to the user (text, images, videos, games, etc).\n",
