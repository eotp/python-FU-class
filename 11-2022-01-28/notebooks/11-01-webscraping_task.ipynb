    "[Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) refers to extracting data from websites. Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else.\n",
