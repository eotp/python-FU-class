# Conda Installation

We use Python throughout the class. We further use some additional packages, installing them individually can be unnecessarily complicated. Hence, we recommend installing Miniconda, which comes with Python (please use 3.x) and the package manager Conda.

_(Note that Conda is a part of the Anaconda distribution. If you are already using the Anaconda distribution you may skip installing Miniconda!)_

## Windows

- Visit [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Download the installer for Python 3.x, for your OS-Architecture (probably `64bit`) and run it.
- You can click on `continue` in each step.

- You should now find two freshly installed programs, in your Start Menu, in the `Anaconda3 (64-bit)` directory.
  - Both spawn a terminal window from which the `conda` command is accessible.
  - **Please use the `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`** _(instead of the `Anaconda prompt`)_ **, as that one also allows inputting typical commands from the UNIX world (macOS, Linux, etc.).**

  - Weiter unten finden Sie eine kurze Übersicht der verfügbaren Kommandos.

## macOS

- Visit [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Download the Python 3.x **pkg** installer and run it.
- You can click on `continue` in each step.
  
![](img/conda-macos-installer.png)

- After you completed the installation, with the next start of the Terminal application you will be able to use the `conda` command.

## Linux

- For Linux there is unfortunately no graphical installer available, thus you need to use your terminal.

### Download

- Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

    ```
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

- In case you don't have `wget` installed, please use the following command instead:

    ```
    curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh > Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

### Installation

- Run the following command to start the installation:
  
    ```
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
- You will be prompted to press `ENTER`, do that.
- Afterwards the EULA will be displayed. Press `q` to quit reading it.
  
![](img/conda-linux-agb.png)

- Enter `yes` and confirm with `ENTER` to accept the terms.
- Next you will be asked to specify the installation path, press `ENTER` to use the default one.
- Now the installer asks whether to initialize `miniconda3`. **Enter `yes` and confirm with `ENTER`**
- After you completed the installation, with the next start of a terminal window you will be able to use the `conda` command.

# Terminal Cheat Sheet

- Hint: You can paste commands into the terminal using:
    - Windows: `CTRL + V`
    - macOS: `CMD + V`
    - Linux: `CTRL + SHIFT + V`

- Hint: You can autocomplete commands and arguments using `TAB`.
- Hint: You can interrupt command execution using `CTRL + C` (e.g. if Conda gets stuck)

## `ls`

- `ls` lists all files and directories in your current path.

    ```
    (base) aleks@pc$ ls
    Desktop Documents Downloads miniconda3 Music Pictures Public Uni Videos
    ```

## `pwd`

- `pwd` returns your current path. Very useful if you should get lost!

    ```
    (base) aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks
    ```

## `cd`

- `cd` (change directory) moves you into a specified directory
- `..` states "one directory above". Thus by using `cd ..` you can switch to one directory above.

    ```
    (base) aleks@pc$ ls
    Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Uni Videos

    (base) aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks

    (base) aleks@pc$ cd Uni
    (base) aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks/Uni

    (base) aleks@pc$ cd ..
    (base) aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks
    ```

- When starting a terminal window your path will be set to your **Home-Directory**. Depending on which Operating System you use the path-names will look different.

  - Windows (`C:\Users\username`):

    ```
    C:\Users\aleks> pwd

    Path
    ----
    C:\Users\aleks
    ```

  - macOS (`/Users/username`):

    ```
    aleks@macOS$ pwd
    /Users/aleks
    ```

  - Linux (`/home/username`):
  
    ```
    aleks@linux$ pwd
    /home/aleks
    ```

- Luckily we can use the same command on each OS to get back to our Home-Directory, i.e. `cd ~` or `cd $HOME`.

    ```
    (base) aleks@pc$ cd aa/bb/cc/dd
    (base) aleks@pc$ cd $HOME
    (base) aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks
    ```

## `mkdir`

- `mkdir` stands for _make directory_.

    ```
    aleks@pc$ ls
    course_a course_b

    aleks@pc$ mkdir abv_dataanalysis_python
    aleks@pc$ ls
    abv_dataanalysis_python course_a course_b
    ```

- We suggest creating a folder for each lecture/session, e.g.:

    ```
    aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks/Uni/abv_dataanalysis_python

    aleks@pc$ mkdir 01_2020_11_06
    ```

**WARNING**

- Please make sure to not use spaces when naming files and directories! As the terminal separates arguments between spaces.

    ```
    aleks@pc$ mkdir abv dataanalysis python
    aleks@pc$ ls
    abv course_a course_b dataanalysis python
    ```

- We now have created three different directories!
- To `cd` into a directory with spaces in the name, put quotation marks (`"` or `'`) around it
    
    ```
    aleks@pc$ ls
    'dir with spaces' dir_a dir_b
    aleks@pc$ cd 'dir with spaces'
    aleks@pc$ pwd
    /home/aleks/dir with spaces
    ```

# Conda Cheat Sheet

- As mentioned before Conda allows us to install Python packages easily, while making sure the package versions work well with another.

- Conda also allows us to create virtual environments, i.e. a separated collection of packages.
- The main idea behind that is to save a state in which we are able to run a project. When revisiting a project in the future some packages may have gotten updated, resulting in the project not running at all or in a different manner. Keeping an environment per project allows to restart the project with exactly the packages with which it has worked in the past!

- It is recommended to add the Conda-forge channel to your Conda channels, so we can install community packages:

    ```
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    ```

## Creating an Conda environment from scratch

- Once you have installed the Conda package manager, we create a virtual environment by installing Python and all other packages of interest.

- Creating an Conda environment with the name `fupy`:

    ```
    conda create -n fupy
    ```

- The default Conda environment is `base`, to switch to the newly created environment use `conda activate environment_name`:
    
    ```
    (base) aleks@pc$ conda activate fupy
    (fupy) aleks@pc$
    ```
- After doing this you can see the changed environment in your Shells' prefix.

## Installing packages

- With the right environment activated you can use `conda install package_1 package_2 [..]` to install packages:

    ```
    (fupy) aleks@pc$ conda install python=3.8 jupyterlab
    ```

- Conda will automatically install all packages on which the chosen ones depend.

## Deleting environment

```
conda env remove -n environment_name
```

## Creating a conda environment from an environment.yml file

_Note: this will be used later in the lecture and is not part of the assignment_

- Once you have installed the Conda package manager, you may create a virtual environment by instructions within a file (e.g. environment.yml). This allows you to recreate an existing environment from another machine.

- Move to your working directory (use `cd`) and make sure the environment.yml is available (use `ls`) and type one of the following command:

    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

- Further you may use the Python module `pip` for downloading additional packages from PyPi, the Python Package Index.

- Packaging in Python is still not yet completely free of pain, hence it is recommended to stay - if possible - within one realm (in our case Conda!), when you start to build more complex and sophisticated software.

# Python

## Launching Python

- From your newly created conda environment you can launch the Python interpreter using (make sure, that you are in the right conda environment! Reminder: You can change the enviroment using `conda activate environment_name`):

    ```
    (fupy) aleks@pc$ python
    Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 07:30:14) 
    [GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    ```

## Launching an Python Application

- Use `cd`, `ls` (and `pwd`) to navigate to the location you created/downloaded a Python file (ending with `.py`)

    ```
    (fupy) aleks@pc$ ls
    Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Uni Videos

    (fupy) aleks@pc$ cd Uni/abv_dataanalysis_python/01_2020_11_06
    (fupy) aleks@pc$ ls
    chatbot.py
    ```

- Launch it using:

    ```
    (fupy) aleks@pc$ python chatbot.py
    Hi, my name is Vincent.
    What's your name?

    ```
