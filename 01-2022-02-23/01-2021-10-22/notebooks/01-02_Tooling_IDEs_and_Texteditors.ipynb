    "Plain text is created and edited by text editors and rich text is created by word processors or desktop publishing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Plain text__ exclusively consists of character representation. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Rich text__ may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. typeface, size, weight and style), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in binary format (e.g. `.doc`), text files adhering to a markup language (e.g. `Markdown` or `HTML`), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. Office Open XML).\n"
