    "# 1. What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**, it defines interactions between multiple software components.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation by only exposing functions a developer might actually need. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can thus also hide informations from developers.\n",
    "On one hand it can hide functions a outside developer shall have no access to, on the other hand it can hide multiple complicated functions inside one simple API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *There are multiple kinds of APIs*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Libraries**:\n",
    "    - Libraries we already got to know are basically APIs, since they abstract and simplify the underlying implementation making it really simple to use them.\n",
    "        - Examples: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`\n",
    "        - E.g. You can find the `sklearn` API Reference at: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html\n",
    "- **Interface between programs**:\n",
    "    - An API might also act as a middleman between two programs.\n",
    "    - E.g. you want to use a library in Python which was implemented for R. An API might translate the Python commands into R to make the library run.\n",
    "- **In Operating Systems**\n",
    "    - Abstract the underlying implementation of the Operating System to make sure the outcome is generic.\n",
    "        - E.g. POSIX is an API standard utilized (mostly) by UNIX systems such as Linux, BSD, macOS\n",
    "        - It makes sure POSIX-conform API calls work the same way on each Operating System\n",
    "        - E.g. the `echo` command shall work the same way independent of the Operating System you use\n",
    "    - Backwards Compatibility:\n",
    "        - E.g. translating old system calls into those utilized in newer OS versions.\n",
    "        - Examples: Win32API (allowing old Windows Programs to be run in `Compatibility Mode` under new versions), being able to play original XBOX/Playstation games on the current Console iteration\n",
    "- **Web API**\n",
    "    - Allow to access functions through Web Protocols, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)\n",
    "    - API defines endpoints (e.g. `api.twitter.com/2/users/by/username/<USERNAME>`) to fetch or push data, or even trigger code execution\n",
    "    - Responses are usually defined in `JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) or `XML` (Extensible Markup Language) (somewhat similar to Python dictionaries)"

    "To get access you need to register as a developer at https://developer.twitter.com/ and apply for API acess.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Not needed for this lecture as we only want to show an example of an API in the real world. You can find the data we will extract in `../data/twitter.p`._\n",
