    "> ### Conduct an exploratory data analysis into the `powerplants` data set. Answer the research questions as stated below and feel fry to add your own quetions of interest. Conduct the analysis using jupyter notebooks and prepare a hmtl based report, including, text, figures and code.\n",

    "- You will be assigned to groups of 3-4 people.\n",
    "- Each group will conduct an analysis for a set of questions. \n",
    "    - Please answer all questions from the set assigned to you and **add at least one further question yourself**.\n",
    "    - _Feel free to add further questions_\n",
    "- Prepare a nicely formatted presentation by exporting your executed Notebooks, e.g. with `jupyterbook`.\n",
    "    - Please `zip` all the files together. \n",
    "    - Make sure all files are included! \n",
    "        - _a good test would be to unzip all files in any different directory and checking if everything is displayed correctly_\n",
    "        - E.g. by only including the exported `.html` file images will be missing. So make sure all folders needed for correct display of the html are included in the zip\n",
    "    - In case the zipped archive is too big to send via e-mail, feel free to upload it to [box.fu-berlin.de](https://box.fu-berlin.de) and share the link with us\n",
    "- Hand in your solutions by **29.03.2022** @ `krois@zedat.fu-berlin.de` and `patric.hausmann@fu-berlin.de` \n",
    "\n",
    "- All groups will present their solutions in a digital format on webex to the class on **31.03.2022** with ca. 30 min of time!"
